## Abstract
Indonesia is the largest archipelago in the world, consisting of 17,504 islands with an area of 1,904,570 km2. In addition, in 2021, Indonesia's population reached 273.8 million people. This causes many problems that occur but cannot be channeled properly. While Indonesia's diverse population, as a result of these geographical features, can give rise to a wide variety of perspectives and ideas.  

According to a 2020 study by Adobe, 61% of respondents find it difficult to generate new and creative ideas. Moreover, 70% of respondents believe that creative ideas are essential for organizations to stay relevant. This caught our attention to create a crowdsourcing application platform called  IdeKita where users can share information, ideas, and resources to be able to make valuable contributions in solving problems or generating new ideas.  IdeKita will be AI-based with features that will bring together experts with problems that are happening according to their expertise so that they can create innovative solutions. By facilitating ideas and turning them into reality, we can help solve the problems faced by Indonesian society.
