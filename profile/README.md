## Background
In 2021, Indonesia's population reached 273.8 million people, leading to numerous unresolved issues. However, with its diverse population, Indonesia possesses a multitude of perspectives and ideas. A 2020 Adobe study revealed that 61% of respondents struggle to generate creative ideas, while 70% believe that creative ideas are essential for organizations.

To address this challenge, we created IdeKita, an application that assists individuals in generating new and creative ideas. Through IdeKita, we foster collaboration among individuals with diverse knowledge and insights, stimulating the growth of fresh ideas and providing tangible contributions to solving complex problems. With IdeKita, we harness the power of technology and individual creativity to bring about positive change in society.
